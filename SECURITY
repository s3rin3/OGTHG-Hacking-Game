## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our platform seriously. If you find a vulnerability in the platform itself (not the intended challenge vulnerabilities), please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose publicly**: Please avoid opening public issues for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Email Disclosure**: Send a detailed report to **ogttamimi@gmail.com** or contact the project creator, **Omar Al Tamimi**, directly via official channels.
3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge all reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation plan within 5 business days.

## Disclosure Policy

- Provide a Proof of Concept (PoC) if possible.
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate the issue before any public disclosure.
- Do not perform any testing that would result in a Denial of Service (DoS) or loss of data for other users.

Thank you for helping keep the OGTHG community safe.
